          Our Moving Stories is a community focussed company currently based in Southall and the surrounding areas. We
          are a
          grassroots organisation made by people for people, exploring the living potential of the moving body and its
          ability to
          communicate narrative, make change and bridge across divides. We facilitate and explore movement practice
          across
          generations and are inclusive of all abilities, believing that everyone has a story to share through movement.



          As well as engaging with movement vocabularies through classes and creative projects, we are keen to connect
          with
          artistic communities beyond dance and provide a platform for the sharing of disciplines inclusive of dance,
          music,
          spoken word, visual art and text.
