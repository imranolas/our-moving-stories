          Our Moving Stories is a community focussed company currently based in Southall and the surrounding areas. We
          are a
          grassroots organisation made by people for people, exploring the living potential of the moving body and its
          ability to
          communicate narrative, make change and bridge across divides. We facilitate and explore movement practice
          across
          generations and are inclusive of all abilities, believing that everyone has a story to share through movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as engaging with movement vocabularies through classes and creative projects, we are keen to connect
          with
          artistic communities beyond dance and provide a platform for the sharing of disciplines inclusive of dance,
          music,
          spoken word, visual art and text.

          We possess a breadth of expertise, delivering dance, movement and yoga classes for all ages and abilities. The
          focus of
          these can be movement for well-being, to develop new or pre-existing skills in dance, as a form of creative
          expression
          and as a way to bring people together. We are always keen to open conversations with activity leaders and
          residents and
          to adapt sessions towards the needs of the existing and emerging needs of communities
